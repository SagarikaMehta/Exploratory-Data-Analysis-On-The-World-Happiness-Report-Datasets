## Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-The-World-Happiness-Report-Datasets
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in python on the world happiness report datasets (for years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019) from Kaggle; to analyze how measurements of well-being (GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption) can effectively help assess the progress of nations across the world.

> Python | (Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) | Plotly python graphing library

• Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
